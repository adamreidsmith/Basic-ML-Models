# Description

## MLR
A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was used to predict the fuel economy of vehicles given attributes of the vehicles, such as weight, engine displacement, and horsepower, which were found within the [Auto MPG Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  Preliminary data analysis involved imputing missing values, inspecting relationships between variables, investigating potential new variables by combining the existing ones, and preparing the data for the MLR algorithm.  The MLR was carried out with the open source machine learning framework [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
